This org is similar to https://github.com/asdf-community but with the advantage of being more secure by keeping the
contributor count minimal—currently only [@jdx](https://github.com/jdx) will be allowed to merge PRs.
For this reason, plugins using this organization will not receive a confirmation warning dialog when
installed with rtx as they've been vetted by a trusted source.

If you're a plugin maintainer that would like to move your repo to this org [please let me know](https://github.com/orgs/rtx-plugins/discussions).
Plugins can either retain compatibility with asdf or use rtx specific functionality—that's up to you.
asdf-compatible plugins should use "asdf-" as the prefix and "rtx-" prefixed-plugins denote rtx-only compatibility.
